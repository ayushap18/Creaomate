## 🌟 The Vision

ArtisanX is more than just a marketplace; it's a complete digital ecosystem designed to bridge the gap between traditional craftsmanship and the global digital economy. We recognize that local artisans face unique barriers: limited access to online tools, intellectual property protection, and promotional resources.

Our mission is to dismantle these barriers. By leveraging the power of Google's Gemini AI, ArtisanX provides a suite of intelligent tools that act as a personal co-pilot for artisans, simplifying complex tasks and amplifying their reach.

## ✨ Key Features

The platform is built around a multi-role architecture, providing tailored, empowering experiences for Artisans, Volunteers, and Customers.

3.  **Conscious Consumers**: Buyers who value authenticity, storytelling, and ethical sourcing, and wish to support small-scale creators and preserve cultural heritage.
